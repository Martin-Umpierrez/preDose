\usage{
run_ind_simulations(
  individual_model,
  tto_occ,
  assessment = c("a_priori", "Bayesian_forecasting", "Complete")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{individual_model}{A list object generated from the `actualize_model` function. It contains posterior estimations for every ID on each occasion.}

\item{tto_occ}{A list object generated from the `run_map_estimations` function. It contains treatment schedules for every ID in each occasion.}

\item{assessment}{Character string. Specifies the type of prediction to perform. Options are:
\itemize{
  \item "a_priori": Simulates concentrations using the population model without individual data.
  \item "Bayesian_Forecasting": Simulates concentrations using individual parameter estimates (posterior mode).
  \item "Complete": Performs both a priori and Bayesian forecasting simulations.
}}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{simulation_results}{A list of simulation results for each occasion and individual.}
\item{ttoocc}{A list of treatments organized by occasion.}
\item{assessment}{A string indicating the type of assessment to perform.} Options are \code{"a_priori"}, \code{"Bayesian_forecasting"}, or \code{"Complete"}.
}
\description{
Simulates individual concentrations based on posterior estimations and treatment schedules for each occasion.
}
\details{
This function performs individual simulations for multiple occasions and individuals at the times an observation is available.
For each posterior estimation, it retrieves the corresponding treatment schedule and executes a simulation
over the specified time range. The results are stored for each individual within each occasion.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming `individual_model` is created with actualize_model
# and `tto_occ` is created with run_map_estimations:

results <- run_ind_simulations(individual_model, tto_occ)

# Access simulation results
sim_results <- results$simulation_results

# Access treatment by occasion
treatments <- results$ttoocc

# Access treatment events
events <- results$events_tto
